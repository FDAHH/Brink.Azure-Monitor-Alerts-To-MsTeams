Their presence depends on various factors; usually you need to manually request them in the context object sent in the payload, but some of them are added automatically under certain conditions.\\n\\n *  `user` ([User](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#user)): The current user. Always available and equal to `null` if the request is anonymous.\\n *  `app` ([App](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#app)): The [Connect app](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/index/#connect-apps) that made the request. Available only for authenticated requests made by Connect Apps (read more here: [Authentication for Connect apps](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/security-for-connect-apps/)).\\n *  `issue` ([Issue](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#issue)): The current issue. Available only when the issue is provided in the request context object.\\n *  `issues` ([List](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#list) of [Issues](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#issue)): A collection of issues matching a JQL query. Available only when JQL is provided in the request context object.\\n *  `project` ([Project](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#project)): The current project. Available only when the project is provided in the request context object.\\n *  `sprint` ([Sprint](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#sprint)): The current sprint. Available only when the sprint is provided in the request context object.\\n *  `board` ([Board](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#board)): The current board. Available only when the board is provided in the request context object.\\n *  `serviceDesk` ([ServiceDesk](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#servicedesk)): The current service desk. Available only when the service desk is provided in the request context object.\\n *  `customerRequest` ([CustomerRequest](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#customerrequest)): The current customer request. Available only when the customer request is provided in the request context object.\\n\\nAlso, custom context variables can be passed in the request with their types. Those variables can be accessed by key in the Jira expression. These variable types are available for use in a custom context:\\n\\n *  `user`: A [user](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#user) specified as an Atlassian account ID.\\n *  `issue`: An [issue](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#issue) specified by ID or key. All the fields of the issue object are available in the Jira expression.\\n *  `json`: A JSON object containing custom content.\\n *  `list`: A JSON list of `user`, `issue`, or `json` variable types.\\n\\nThis operation can be accessed anonymously.\\n\\n**[Permissions](#permissions) required**: None. However, an expression may return different results for different users depending on their permissions. For example, different users may see different comments on the same issue.  \\nPermission to access Jira Software is required to access Jira Software context variables (`board` and `sprint`) or fields (for example, `issue.sprint`).\",\r\n        \"operationId\": \"evaluateJiraExpression\",\r\n        \"parameters\": [\r\n          {\r\n            \"name\": \"expand\",\r\n            \"in\": \"query\",\r\n            \"description\": \"Use [expand](#expansion) to include additional information in the response.

permission scheme is a collection of permission grants. A permission grant consists of a `holder` and a `permission`.\\n\\n#### Holder object ####\\n\\nThe `holder` object contains information about the user or group being granted the permission. For example, the *Administer projects* permission is granted to a group named *Teams in space administrators*. In this case, the type is `\\\"type\\\": \\\"group\\\"`, and the parameter is the group name, `\\\"parameter\\\": \\\"Teams in space administrators\\\"` and the value is group ID, `\\\"value\\\": \\\"ca85fac0-d974-40ca-a615-7af99c48d24f\\\"`. The `holder` object is defined by the following properties:\\n\\n *  `type` Identifies the user or group (see the list of types below).\\n *  `parameter` As a group's name can change, use of `value` is recommended. The value of this property depends on the `type`. For example, if the `type` is a group, then you need to specify the group name.\\n *  `value` The value of this property depends on the `type`. If the `type` is a group, then you need to specify the group ID. For other `type` it has the same value as `parameter`\\n\\nThe following `types` are available. The expected values for `parameter` and `value` are given in parentheses (some types may not have a `parameter` or `value`):\\n\\n *  `anyone` Grant for anonymous users.\\n *  `applicationRole` Grant for users with access to the specified application (application name, application name). See [Update product access settings](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/3YxjL) for more information.\\n *  `assignee` Grant for the user currently assigned to an issue.\\n *  `group` Grant for the specified group (`parameter` : group name, `value` : group ID).\\n *  `groupCustomField` Grant for a user in the group selected in the specified custom field (`parameter` : custom field ID, `value` : custom field ID).\\n *  `projectLead` Grant for a project lead.\\n *  `projectRole` Grant for the specified project role (`parameter` :project role ID, `value` : project role ID).\\n *  `reporter` Grant for the user who reported the issue.\\n *  `sd.customer.portal.only` Jira Service Desk only. Grants customers permission to access the customer portal but not Jira. See [Customizing Jira Service Desk permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/24dKLg) for more information.\\n *  `user` Grant for the specified user (`parameter` : user ID - historically this was the userkey but that is deprecated and the account ID should be used, `value` : user ID).\\n *  `userCustomField` Grant for a user selected in the specified custom field (`parameter` : custom field ID, `value` : custom field ID).\\n\\n#### Built-in permissions ####\\n\\nThe [built-in Jira permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) are listed below. Apps can also define custom permissions.

In Jira Cloud, the list of project roles is shared globally with all projects, but each project can have a different set of actors associated with it (unlike groups, which have the same membership throughout all Jira applications).\\n\\nProject roles are used in [permission schemes](#api-rest-api-3-permissionscheme-get), [email notification schemes](#api-rest-api-3-notificationscheme-get), [issue security levels](#api-rest-api-3-issuesecurityschemes-get), [comment visibility](#api-rest-api-3-comment-list-post), and workflow conditions.\\n\\n#### Members and actors ####\\n\\nIn the Jira REST API, a member of a project role is called an *actor*. An *actor* is a group or user associated with a project role.\\n\\nActors may be set as [default members](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/3odKLg#Managingprojectroles-Specifying'defaultmembers'foraprojectrole) of the project role or set at the project level:\\n\\n *  Default actors: Users and groups that are assigned to the project role for all newly created projects.

Otherwise, a draft workflow scheme is created.\\n *  Update an active workflow scheme with `updateDraftIfNeeded` set to `false`: An error is returned, as active workflow schemes cannot be updated.\\n *  Update an inactive workflow scheme with `updateDraftIfNeeded` set to `true`: The workflow scheme is updated, as inactive workflow schemes do not require drafts to update.\\n\\nDefaults to `false`.\"\r\n          }\r\n        },\r\n        \"additionalProperties\": false,\r\n        \"description\": \"Details about a workflow scheme.\"\r\n      },\r\n      \"WorkflowSchemeAssociation\": {\r\n        \"required\": [\r\n          \"issueTypeIds\",\r\n          \"workflowId\"\r\n        ],\r\n        \"type\": \"object\",\r\n        \"properties\": {\r\n          \"issueTypeIds\": {\r\n            \"uniqueItems\": true,\r\n            \"type\": \"array\",\r\n            \"description\": \"The issue types assigned to the workflow.\",\r\n            \"items\": {\r\n              \"type\": \"string\",\r\n              \"description\": \"The issue types assigned to the workflow.\"\r\n            }\r\n          },\r\n          \"workflowId\": {\r\n            \"type\": \"string\",\r\n            \"description\": \"The ID of the workflow.\"\r\n          }\r\n        },\r\n        \"additionalProperties\": false,\r\n        \"description\": \"The explicit association between issue types and a workflow in a workflow scheme.\"\r\n      },\r\n      \"WorkflowSchemeAssociations\": {\r\n        \"required\": [\r\n          \"projectIds\",\r\n          \"workflowScheme\"\r\n        ],\r\n        \"type\": \"object\",\r\n        \"properties\": {\r\n          \"projectIds\": {\r\n            \"type\": \"array\",\r\n            \"description\": \"The list of projects that use the workflow scheme.\",\r\n            \"items\": {\r\n              \"type\": \"string\"\r\n            }\r\n          },\r\n          \"workflowScheme\": {\r\n            \"description\": \"The workflow scheme.\",\r\n            \"allOf\": [\r\n              {\r\n                \"$ref\": \"#/components/schemas/WorkflowScheme\"\r\n              }\r\n            ]\r\n          }\r\n        },\r\n        \"additionalProperties\": false,\r\n        \"description\": \"A workflow scheme along with a list of projects that use it.\"\r\n      },\r\n      \"WorkflowSchemeIdName\": {\r\n        \"required\": [\r\n          \"id\",\r\n          \"name\"\r\n        ],\r\n        \"type\": \"object\",\r\n        \"properties\": {\r\n          \"id\": {\r\n            \"type\": \"string\",\r\n            \"description\": \"The ID of the workflow scheme.\"\r\n          },\r\n          \"name\": {\r\n            \"type\": \"string\",\r\n            \"description\": \"The name of the workflow scheme.\"\r\n          }\r\n        },\r\n        \"additionalProperties\": false,\r\n        \"description\": \"The ID and the name of the workflow scheme.\"\r\n      },\r\n      \"WorkflowSchemeProjectAssociation\": {\r\n        \"required\": [\r\n          \"projectId\"\r\n        ],\r\n        \"type\": \"object\",\r\n        \"properties\": {\r\n          \"projectId\": {\r\n            \"type\": \"string\",\r\n            \"description\": \"The ID of the project.\"\r\n          },\r\n          \"workflowSchemeId\": {\r\n            \"type\": \"string\",\r\n            \"description\": \"The ID of the workflow scheme.

The most common permissions are:\\n\\n- **Administer the Cloud site**: Users in the _site-admins_ group have this \\npermission. See [Manage groups](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/24xjL) for details.\\n- **Administer Jira**: Granted by the _Jira Administrators_ global permission.

This can be \\ngranted to a user, a group, a project role, and more. \\nSee [Managing project permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) for details.\\n- **Access Jira**: Granted by the _Jira Users_ global permission.

However, anonymous access is only available if \\nthe Jira permission needed to access the object or records returned by the operation is granted to \\nthe _Public_ group. See [Allowing anonymous access to your project](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/GDxxLg) \\nfor details.\\n\\nIf an operation is called anonymously and anonymous access is not available, the operation will return \\nan error. Note that not all operations that correspond to objects that can be given public access \\nprovide for anonymous access.\\n\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"title\": \"Expansion, pagination, and ordering\",\r\n        \"anchor\": \"expansion\",\r\n        \"body\": \"### Expansion\\n\\nThe Jira REST API uses resource expansion, which means that some parts of a resource are not returned unless specified \\nin the request. This simplifies responses and minimizes network traffic.\\n\\nTo expand part of a resource in a request, use the expand query parameter and specify the object(s) to be expanded. \\nIf you need to expand nested objects, use the `.` dot notation. If you need to expand multiple objects, use a \\ncomma-separated list. \\n\\nFor example, the following request expands the `names` and `renderedFields` properties for the _JRACLOUD-34423_ issue:\\n\\n`GET issue/JRACLOUD-34423?expand=names,renderedFields`\\n\\nTo discover which object can be expanded, refer to the `expand` property in the object. \\nIn the JSON example below, the resource declares `widgets` as expandable.\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"expand\\\": \\\"widgets\\\", \\n  \\\"self\\\": \\\"https://your-domain.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/resource/KEY-1\\\", \\n  \\\"widgets\\\": {\\n    \\\"widgets\\\": [],\\n    \\\"size\\\": 5\\n   }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Pagination\\n\\nThe Jira REST API uses pagination to improve performance. Pagination is enforced for operations that could return a large \\ncollection of items. When you make a request to a paginated resource, the response wraps the returned array of values in \\na JSON object with paging metadata. For example:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n    \\\"startAt\\\" : 0,\\n    \\\"maxResults\\\" : 10,\\n    \\\"total\\\": 200,\\n    \\\"isLast\\\": false,\\n    \\\"values\\\": [\\n        { /* result 0 */ },\\n        { /* result 1 */ },\\n        { /* result 2 */ }\\n    ]\\n}\\n```\\n\\n*   `startAt` is the index of the first item returned in the page.\\n*   `maxResults` is the maximum number of items that a page can return. Each operation can have a different limit for\\n    the number of items returned, and these limits may change without notice. To find the maximum number of items \\n    that an operation could return, set `maxResults` to a large number—for example, over 1000—and if the returned value of `maxResults` is less than the requested value, the returned value is the maximum.\\n*    `total` is the total number of items contained in all pages. This number **_may change_** as the client \\nrequests the subsequent pages, therefore the client should always assume that the requested page can be empty. Note \\nthat this property is not returned for all operations.\\n*   `isLast` indicates whether the page returned is the last one. Note that this property is not returned for all operations.\\n\\n### Ordering\\n\\nSome operations support ordering the elements of a response by a field. Check the documentation for the operation to \\nconfirm whether ordering of a response is supported and which fields can be used. Responses are listed in ascending order \\nby default. You can change the order using the `orderby` query parameter with a `-` or `+` symbol. For example:\\n\\n*   `?orderBy=name` to order by `name` field ascending.\\n*   `?orderBy=+name` to order by `name` field ascending.\\n*   `?orderBy=-name` to order by `name` field descending.\\n\\n\\n\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"title\": \"Special headers\",\r\n        \"anchor\": \"special-request-headers\",\r\n        \"body\": \"The following request and response headers define important metadata for the Jira Cloud REST API resources.\\n\\n-   `X-Atlassian-Token` (request): Operations that accept multipart/form-data must include the `X-Atlassian-Token: no-check`\\nheader in requests.

This means that an anonymous user who may be able to perform an action through Jira, may not be able to perform the same action where it's enabled by the REST API. \\n\\n The operations that provide anonymous access are annotated \\\"This operation can be accessed anonymously.\\\"\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"title\": \"Asynchronous operations\",\r\n        \"anchor\": \"async-operations\",\r\n        \"body\": \"Some Jira REST API operations may trigger long-running or computationally expensive tasks. In these cases, the operation \\nwill schedule an asynchronous task and return a `303 (See Other)` response, indicating the location of the queued task \\nin the `Location` header. You can query this task to get progress updates.\\n\\nWhen the task finishes, the response object will contain the `result` field. The content of the field is specific to the \\noperation that created the task. Refer to the operation’s documentation for more information.\\n\\nNote that asynchronous tasks are not guaranteed to be run in order.
